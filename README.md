# Kobold Comforts Mod

This is a Vintage Story content mod for short kobolds!

**Highly recommended**: To actually fit your player character through the 1-block-tall doors, use the [Kobold Player Model Redux](https://mods.vintagestory.at/koboldrdx) mod and set your character height to 50% or less. Kobold Comforts itself has no hard dependencies.

## Description

Only another kobold truly understands how difficult life can be when you are smol. Bigfolk build everything too tall and too wide, and every home feels like it was made for giants.

This mod focuses on smol friendly comforts that make the world feel sized for kobolds again. It adds compact doors perfect for smol kobolds, house pets, and scurrying critters, with full door functionality, including locking and support for various wood types.

Unlike gates and fences, these doors block light and create valid "Rooms" in Vintage Story, making them perfect for building proper kobold-sized homes.

The mod is meant to grow over time with even more kobold sized comforts.

### Moss Culture

Grow moss in a barrel! Put 8 rot and 20 liters of water in a sealed barrel, wait 5 days (120 hours), and get 32 moss culture. Very mossy! If you don't know where to store them, put the on the ground!
